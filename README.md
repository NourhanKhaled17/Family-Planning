# Family-Planning
Family planning is having the number of children you want, when you want them. 
This app explains the many safe, effective methods to prevent pregnancy. 
It includes a Method Chooser to help you determine which method is right for you or the person you are counseling.
A section on Counseling can help you improve your skills.
The right to decide when to get pregnant and when to prevent pregnancy is central to our right to health. 
People are healthier when they can decide for themselves when to have sex, and if and when to have children.
Access to contraception enables us to make those decisions
